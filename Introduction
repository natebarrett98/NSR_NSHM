Hello ,

This is an introduction to two new schools that will be opening up soon, these schools being The Noble School of the Root and The Noble School of 
the Hospitable Woman


-- Why these schools were formed

In todays world, we have lost touch with our ability as a community to assemble and have a proper culture. This has stemmed from a multitude of factors : social media,
hyper consummerism, and the breakdown of our understanding of human beings to name a few.

We as a community need to seek greener pastures, and be able to formulate a network and society that can help to heal our currently sick socity. To do that we need a new
nobilty.

The term nobility has taken many forms throughout the years. But I believe the nobility serves as the group of people who both check the elite as well as the poor,
the balancers of the community to when there is inbalance can take action through assembly to form a better overall lifestyle for all. 

-- The Noble School of the Root

The Noblemen of the society are to lead. The Noblemen of the society were set up to be farmers, who could support and sustain a community while taking assembly to
mange its affairs. The Noble School of the Root will serve to cultivate the young men (ages 21 to 35) who have the potential to take on this grand task

-- The Noble School of the Hospitable Woman

As with all Nobleman who wish to guide and lead the society, there needs to be a special set of woman will look to preserve the harmony and passion of the community,
to be at the Noblemans side during the toughest of situations and make tough descions of how the soceity is should be operated and ran through daily life. For these
woman will be the fruit that makes the confines of the society grow each day. The Noble School of the Hospitable Woman will serve to cultivate the young women 
(ages 21 to 35) who have the potential to take on this grand task
